# DBIS_work
This implementation will work with c++ ,postgreSQL and with CLion(optional).
Inside CLion, just load CMakeLists.txt and build the project.
After this, a simple run of the project should return the desired results.
Make sure that the postgres service is working and ready to accept connections.
On Unix terminal this can be done with the following commands:
$sudo systemctl status postgresql
$sudo pg_isready
